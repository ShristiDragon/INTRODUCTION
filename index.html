    <h1>Hi, I am Shristi.</h1>
    <h2>I love coding but I am in learning phase.</h2>
    <p>I'm 8th semester running student from Pokhara, Trivuwan University.
       Currently seeking for an intern in Kathmandu. I have a base knowledge in C, C++, Java, Php, Mysql, Python. <br>A little knowledge is dangerous , that's why I'm trying to learn from internet as much as I can.
       I really have that inner excitement to work in real world.I want to know how actually everything works.<br>I can adjust in any situation that comes through my task, I can be calm and be communicative.
       I hope for the better future in this field.</p>
